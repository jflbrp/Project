    <h2>Salem overview: Integrity</h2>
    <h3>What is integrity?</h3>
    <p class="integrity">Integrity is the quality to have strong moral principles and be honest, in other words moral uprightness. It can also be interpreted as the state of being whole and undivided. The word is very open to interpretation and often used in context with a respected and trusted person.</p>

                Abigail Williams
            </h5>
            <p>
                Abigail Williams is Reverend Parris's nephew and the leader of the accusing girls. She has a low integrity, as she keeps hanging people to stay in power and keep the village's attention. She also lies at every chance she gets. She laughs at prayer, which is not good at all and to top things of she made Proctor sin.

            <p>
                John Proctor is a farmer who is hanged at the end of the play. John porctor is a lecher, which doesn't help his integrity. But he admits to it in order to ddo the right thing sacrifices everything to end the hanging and rather hangs than lying to the court. On top of that he's a very respected member of the village.

            <p>
                Rebecca Nurse is an elderly woman, who is well respected in Salem. She always attends church never overreacts, never sins and never involves herself in shady stuff. When confronted with the accusation of witchcraft she stays composed and doesn't lie . She stands her ground, showing how a perfectly executed Puritan lifestyle should look like.

            <h5>Mary Warren</h5>
            <p>
                Mary Warren is also one of the girls, but she participated the least. She works at the Proctor's. She got fooled by the trials herself, to the point where she imagined spirits that weren't there whilst in the court. As soon as she realized she very hesitantly ratted them out. She wasn't all to keen about doing the right thing and primarily concerned with herself. In Act III she lost her mind and knowingly did the wrong thing, allowing his death.

        <h3>Background to the Witch Trials</h3>
        <p>Salem was in crisis around the time of the witch trials. A smallpox epidemic, an influx of immigrants, competition with other towns etc. caused a tense and suspicious enviroment in Salem. Apart from that, Puritan society didn't work as well as assumed. The lack of activities for young girls, directly led to the girls conmitting witchcraft fraud. On top of that the most powerful people in the town(Putnam, Parris, Danforth etc.) all benefited from the trials.</p>
